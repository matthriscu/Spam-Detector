I have only implemented the criteria provided in the problem statement.

I attempted to use a "url score" based on how secure the links present in each
email are, but this takes way too long and I end up getting TLE when running the
checker. My idea was to increase the score based on 2 factors: whether the site
was using https and whether they ended up redirecting the user to another
domain.

Keywords are stored in a list, while spammer addresses and scores are stored in
a dictionary.

Each email is split into lines and the various scores are calculated.

Finally, the standard deviation is calculated for each keyword and a prediction
is made as to weather the email is spam or not. I have slightly adjusted the
coefficients of each score to get a higher F1 score.
